## Plot review

![alt text](Plot.png)

Your plot is a clear representation of the number of shelter buildings in each borough.  If you had access to the counts over time, perhaps you could render time series for each borough that might illuminate some worthwhile insights.  I like that you tested your plot for visibility for people with color blindness issues.  Perhaps it would make sense to normalize your counts by population...that is, plot homeless shelters per person instead of just plotting counts, because population varies greatly by borough.
