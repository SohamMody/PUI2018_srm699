## This is Homework 8 for the subject Principle of Urban Informatics.

### Assignment-1 : I have plotted the number of shelter buildings for families with children grouped by the NYC boroughs.

###### Figure 1 : The plot shows the number of shelter buildings for families with children for boroughes of New  York City. Bronx has the highest while Staten Island has almost none which kind of makes sense.
