### This is Homework-10 for PUI.

#### For assignment-1 , we worked with the Anscomby distributions and fit linear and quadratic OLS models to the data. Then, we performed LR tests to check which model was better.

#### For assignment-2, we worked with applying linear regression models to energy consumption data of Manhattan. We compared various models and their performance based on parameters like R^2 and log-likelihood. We also calculated the errors possible in the model and the chi square values for the models incorporating those.

### I worked on this Homework by myself but, I did go to Ilyas(the TA) for more clarity about the error plots and the log likelihood surface.
