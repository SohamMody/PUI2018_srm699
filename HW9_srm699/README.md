## This is Homework-9 for the subject Principle of Urban Informatics.

### Assignment 1: 
For this , I reviewed the plots made by Shenghao(Lavender) Zhang-sz2404 and Jingxi Zhao-jz3309 for their homework-8 of PUI based on their clarity,esthetic and honesty. I uploaded my review on my fork of their repostory and then, created pull requests to merge them. I did this part by myself.

### Assignment 2:
I worked on calculations and plotting of errors/uncertainities in this assignment. I also learnt how to fit the data with a line using methods like ols and wls and which fits look better for what kind of data. Like, adding a constant to the exogenous variable improves the fit for a line with higher number of data-points while it doesn't matter that much for lines with fewer data-points. I worked with Timur Mukhtarov for this assignment.

### Assignment 3:
I had to do a lot of data wrangling and processing at the start of the assignment to get the data in correctly. The final dataset was countrywise data of number of shootings , civilian firearms and so on. Then, we had to make plots of these variables along with the errorbars and identify outliers. Then, we had to do some modeling and describe our findings for the same.
