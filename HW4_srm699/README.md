In this homework, we played around with different stats distributions like Poisson, Normal and others. We noticed that given a big enough count of samples for any distribution, they tend to look like Gaussian(Normal) distribution.
Also, we learnt hypothesis testing by formulating a null hypothesis and alternate hypothesis. 
We also learnt how to reject the null hypothesis beyond any doubt by performing statistical tests like the Z-test.
I worked by myself on this homework and it has been done in its entireity by me.
