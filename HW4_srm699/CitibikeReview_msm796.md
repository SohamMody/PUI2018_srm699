I had forked Soham's repository and inspected his HW4 Assignment 2, on whether the trip duration of citibike customers will be longer than citibike subscribers.

a. Soham had properly stated his null and alternative hypothesis both in words considering what idea he has in mind for this.
Although there is an error with the formula version of his null hypothesis. As his null hypothesis in words mentions that the average
duration of subscribers should be same or higher than customers. However his formula shows that customers will have higher or equal to. 
His alternative hypothesis is correctly translated from words to mathematical notation.
b. Soham had performed the necessary processing of his data for his investigation. He subdivided his dataset based on the usertype and
retained the biking duration field, and had done some exploration of his data.
c. Soham is conducting a comparison of two samples, checking whether there is truly a statistical difference between the two samples, considering
the plots that Soham made, one can notice they don't follow or resemble the normal distribution. Thus it would be appropriate to choose a
non-parametric test for this investigation. A 2 groups Mann-Whitney U test will be appropriate with his testing.
d. I am not clear on the reasoning behind the exclusion of outliers if it were to be the appropriate treatment of the data as the only reasoning is to improve the visualization of the distribution plot or the reason why the he chose a specific value for the threshold of his cut-off.  I think this is an area that can be improved on. I think a histogram with subgroups based on customer type of the data can be created then exploring the distribution of each subgroup. I attempted to do this and noticed opportunity to further motivate the exclusion of outliers and an interesting rightly skewed distribution.
