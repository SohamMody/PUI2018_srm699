# Homework 6 for PUI

In Assignment-1, we had to practice data manipulation using Pandas. We revised things like drop, merge , rename and so on. I worked with Timur Mukhtarov for this part of the homework.

Assignment-2 was how to work with databases in Pyhton using APIs for Sql. I practiced SQL operations like select using where clause, extract, group by as well as ST_Distance_Sphere and ST_MakeLine. I did this part of the assignment by myself.
