### This is Homework-12(the last..whew) for the subject Principles of Urban Informatics.

### Assignment-1(available ![here](https://github.com/SohamMody/PUI2018_srm699/blob/master/HW12_srm699/HW12_Assignment1_srm699.ipynb)) : We continued to work with the MTA subway number of rides data from HW-11. We found the stations with the most prominent periodicity across the year amongst 600 Manhattan stations.To do this, we had to use Fourier Transforms, which are inbuilt in Numpy functions. I took Pablo Mandiola's help for choosing the number of samples for the calculation of frequency.

### Assignment-2(available ![here](https://github.com/SohamMody/PUI2018_srm699/blob/master/HW12_srm699/HW12_Assignment2_srm699.ipynb)) : We had to do k-means clustering for the number of establishments across NYC from 1994 to 2014 according to the Business Census Buraeu Data. I checked various values of k to see which would give better results.I visualised the same as time series as well as on the map of NYC. I also did agglomerative clustering for the same and made a dendrogram using hierarchial clustering. All these were efforts to better understand the structure and distribution of the data. I took help from Pablo to plot the cluster centers. 

#### I did both the assignments by myself.
