### This is Homework-12(the last..whew) for the subject Principles of Urban Informatics.

### Assignment-1 : We continued to work with the MTA subway number of rides data from HW-11. We found the stations with the most prominent periodicity across the year.To do this, we had to use Fourier Transforms, which are inbuilt in Numpy functions.

### Assignment-2 : We had to do k-means clustering for the number of establishments across NYC from 1994 to 2014 according to the Business Census Buraeu Data. I checked various values of k to see which would give better results.I visualised the same as time series as well as on the map of NYC. I also did agglomerative clustering for the same and made a dendrogram using hierarchial clustering. All these were efforts to better understand the structure and distribution of the data. I took help from Pablo Mandiola to plot the cluster centers. 

#### I did both the assignments by myself.
